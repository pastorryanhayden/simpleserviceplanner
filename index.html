					<p class="editable">I built this tool with the church where I serve as pastor in mind. I was sick of thumbing though a hymn book, guessing how long it's been since we sung that song.  I wanted my Assistant Pastor, pianists, and musicians to be on the same page.
					<br>
					I sincerely hope that it is a blessing to your church.
