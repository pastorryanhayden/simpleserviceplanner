title: Access and Setup your Simple Church Planner
---

In order to setup the Simple Church Planner you are going to need to do a couple of things.  Don't worry, it shouldn't take too much of your time and should save you tons of time in the future:

### Step One - Sign Up For An Airtable Account

Click [this link](https://airtable.com/invite/r/MW9nJ7HK) to sign up for a free Airtable account if you don't already have one. 

### Step Two - Copy Our Template Base Into Your Account

Click on [this link](#) and click the large "copy base" button.

### Step Three - Find and write down your Airtable API Key and the base APP ID.

**You'll find your API key** by 1) clicking on your user avitar and  2) clicking Account info.  You should either see your API key at the bottom of the page or see the option to create one.

**Find your bases APP ID** by clicking on the little question icon and then selecting "API documentation."  Now, look at the URL bar - your APP Id is the glob right after "airtable.com/" and before the next "/."  It should look something like this: `app0OkBvB0JJuNqKk`


### Step Four - Start entering your information.

You can start planning your services right away.  This video will explain how it all works:

You can import hymnal indexes.  Right now we have these you can download:

* Rejoice Hymns by Majesty Music
* Crown Hymns by Crown Christian Publications
* Bible Truth Hymns by Bible Truth Music
* Living Hymns by Striving Together Publications

If you have another hymnal you need, we can get it entered for a small fee.

### Step Five - Download your Order of Service generator file, open it and enter your API key and APP ID.

Download [this file](#). (It may open in another tab and you'll have to select FILE > SAVE.) 

Be sure to save the file somewhere where you will remember it.  Then open the file in Google Chrome.  You'll be asked to enter your API Key and AppID.  (You should only have to do this once but save them just in case.)  

Now you should see a list of all of your upcoming services.  Just click on one and click FILE > PRINT.  Make sure your print as landscape.
