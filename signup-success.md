# There are five steps to setting up the Simple Church Planner
### Don't worry, they'll only take a minute.

Follow these steps explained in the video above and the text below:

### Step One - Sign Up For An Airtable Account

Click [this link](https://airtable.com/invite/r/MW9nJ7HK) to sign up for a free Airtable account if you don't already have one. 

### Step Two - Copy Our Template Base Into Your Account


Click on [this link](https://airtable.com/shreXBDXQHJCMOHuM) and click the large "copy base" button.

### Step Three - Find and write down your Airtable API Key and the base APP ID.


**You'll find your API key** by 1) clicking on your user avitar and  2) clicking Account info.  You should either see your API key at the bottom of the page or see the option to create one.


**Find your bases APP ID** by clicking on the little question icon and then selecting "API documentation."  Now, look at the URL bar - your APP Id is the glob right after "airtable.com/" and before the next "/."  It should look something like this: `app0OkBvB0JJuNqKk`


### Step Four - Start entering your information.

You can start planning your services right away.  This video will explain how it all works:


You can import hymnal indexes.  Right now we have these you can download:

* Rejoice Hymns by Majesty Music
* Crown Hymns by Crown Christian Publications
* Bible Truth Hymns by Bible Truth Music
* Living Hymns by Striving Together Publications

If you have another hymnal you need, we can get it entered for a small fee.

### Step Five - Go to [mychurch.simplechurchplanner.com](http://mychurch.simplechurchplanner.com) open it and enter your API key and APP ID.

Again, that link is [here](http://mychurch.simplechurchplanner.com)

> Note, this will store your API Key and APP ID on YOUR COMPUTER.  If you clear out your browser's cookies, switch browsers, or swictch computers, you'll have to enter it again.

Now you should see a list of all of your upcoming services.  Just click on one and click FILE > PRINT.  Make sure your print as landscape.
