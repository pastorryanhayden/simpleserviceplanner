# There are five steps to setting up the Simple Church Planner
### Don't worry, they'll only take a minute.

Follow these steps explained in the video above and the text below:

### Step One - Sign Up For An Airtable Account

Click [this link](https://airtable.com/invite/r/MW9nJ7HK) to sign up for a free Airtable account if you don't already have one. 

### Step Two - Copy Our Template Base Into Your Account


Click on [this link for a blank planner with no hymnal](https://airtable.com/shreXBDXQHJCMOHuM) and click the large "copy base" button.

OR:

* [Planner with Rejoice Hymns](https://airtable.com/shrYt1Z9WHzAqZxQA)
* [Soul Stirring Songs & Hymns](https://airtable.com/shrrg2dloFWgUysES)
* [The Hymnal for Worship & Celebration](https://airtable.com/shrTUjgan0KKhB3v6)

Check back LATER TODAY (Thursday April 13) and you should see:

* Living Hymns
* Bible Truth Hymns
* Majesty Hymns
* Celebtration Hymnal
* Songs & Hymns of Revival

I'm working on adding:
* Crown Hymns
* Songs and Hymns of the Heart

### Step Three - Find and write down your Airtable API Key and the base APP ID.


**You'll find your API key** by 1) clicking on your user avitar and  2) clicking Account info.  You should either see your API key at the bottom of the page or see the option to create one.


**Find your bases APP ID** by clicking on the little question icon and then selecting "API documentation."  Now, look at the URL bar - your APP Id is the glob right after "airtable.com/" and before the next "/."  It should look something like this: `app0OkBvB0JJuNqKk`


### Step Four - Start entering your information.

You can start planning your services right away.  This video will explain how it all works:


You can import hymnal indexes.  If you click on a link in step 2, we have hymnals already added so you can skip this. THIS IS FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO DO THIS PART THEMSELVES.

To add it, click on the link and save the CSV file.  Open the CSV file in a spreadsheet app (Google Sheets, Microsoft Excel, etc.) Then select and copy everything.  Then open the Service Planner on Airtable, select the "Hymns" tab, and select EDIT > PASTE.

(See this article for a visual example: https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/218325187-Appending-data-to-an-existing-table-with-copy-and-paste) 



If you have another hymnal you need, we can get it entered for a small fee.

### Step Five - Go to [mychurch.simplechurchplanner.com](http://mychurch.simplechurchplanner.com) open it and enter your API key and APP ID.

Again, that link is [here](http://mychurch.simplechurchplanner.com)

> Note, this will store your API Key and APP ID on YOUR COMPUTER.  If you clear out your browser's cookies, switch browsers, or swictch computers, you'll have to enter it again.

Now you should see a list of all of your upcoming services.  Just click on one and click FILE > PRINT.  Make sure your print as landscape.
