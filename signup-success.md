# There are five steps to setting up the Simple Church Planner
### Don't worry, they'll only take a minute.

Follow these steps explained in the video above and the text below:

### Step One - Sign Up For An Airtable Account

Click <a href="https://airtable.com/invite/r/MW9nJ7HK" target="blank">this link</a>to sign up for a free Airtable account if you don't already have one. 

### Step Two - Copy Our Template Base Into Your Account


Click on the hymnal you use below and then click on the large "copy base button" (Top right corner):

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://airtable.com/shrYt1Z9WHzAqZxQA" target="blank">Rejoice Hymns </a></li>
    <li><a href="https://airtable.com/shrTHMd1gGTWwP6ta" target="blank">Majesty Hymns</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://airtable.com/shrrg2dloFWgUysES" target="blank">Soul Stirring Songs &amp; Hymns </a></li>
    <li><a href="https://airtable.com/shrTUjgan0KKhB3v6" target="blank">The Hymnal for Worship &amp; Celebration</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://airtable.com/shrYHnjWDAylURDwP" target="blank">Celebration Hymnal</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://airtable.com/shrFu37chX9pB7kai" target="blank">Songs and Hymns of Revival</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://airtable.com/shrWxj9Ult7C2uQ8b" target="blank">Bible Truth Hymns</a></li>
    li><a href="https://airtable.com/shr6E6skbqXzI9Wyx" target="blank">Living Hymns</a></li>
</ul>

OR click on on:

[this link for a blank planner with no hymnal](https://airtable.com/shreXBDXQHJCMOHuM) and click the large "copy base" button.  

> NOTE: Some of these hymnals are so large, you may find yourself starting outside of Airtable's free tier (1200 records.). Eventually I'm going to redo these so that first lines are on another row than Song Titles to shrink the numbers down a little.

I'm working on adding:
* Crown Hymns
* Songs and Hymns of the Heart

I just need to get ahold of their index in a digital format.  If there is another hymnbook you would like me to add, please let me know and we'll get to work on it.

### Step Three - Find and write down your Airtable API Key and the base APP ID.


**You'll find your API key** by 1) clicking on your user avitar and  2) clicking Account info.  You should either see your API key at the bottom of the page or see the option to create one.


**Find your bases APP ID** by clicking on the little question icon and then selecting "API documentation."  Now, look at the URL bar - your APP Id is the glob right after "airtable.com/" and before the next "/."  It should look something like this: `app0OkBvB0JJuNqKk`


### Step Four - Start entering your information.

You can start planning your services right away.  The video above explains how it all works.


### Step Five - Go to [mychurch.simplechurchplanner.com](http://mychurch.simplechurchplanner.com) open it and enter your API key and APP ID.

Again, that link is <a href="http://mychurch.simplechurchplanner.com" target="blank">here</a>

> Note, this will store your API Key and APP ID on YOUR BROWSER STORAGE.  If you clear out your browser's cookies, switch browsers, or switch computers, you'll have to enter it again.

Now you should see a list of all of your upcoming services.  Just click on one and click FILE > PRINT.  Make sure your print as landscape.
