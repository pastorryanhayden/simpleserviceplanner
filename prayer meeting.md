Does your church have a weekly prayer meeting?  Mine does.  Which means two things:

1) Every week I have to take down new prayer requests.
2) Every week I have to give a prayer request handout.

To be honest - up until last year - most of the prayer requests we took got lost. (Maybe they went where my sock matches go).  Also, the handouts would take an hour every week to generate.

Now, we record the prayer requests in Airtable and we can pull them up whenever and see who we need to pray for, when they were added, and who requested it.  It's one million times better than just writing them down on paper.

Plus, we can take automatically generate prayer request sheets, take prayer requests online using a form, and put our prayer requests on our website.  

Here is a FREEBIE: You can clone our Airtable base for prayer requests here:  https://airtable.com/shrLlJRDcERT0Xgkz.  Feel free to tweak this however you would like.

If you'd like to have me create a weekly handout for you, REPLY TO THIS EMAIL and I'll customize one for the one time cost of $50.  

That's $50 that could save you more than 50 HOURS a year.
